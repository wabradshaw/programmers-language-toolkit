/**
 * <p>
 * An AAnTrie is a data structure representing whether the start of a word typically gets described using "a" or "an".
 * AAnTries are arranged into a tree structure where each node represents a particular character of the string, and
 * whether most words (up to that character) use "a" or "an". Each node contains further AAnTrie nodes for future
 * letters.
